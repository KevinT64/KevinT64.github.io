   		<td>[Piece 1: My social justice topic is police brutality and racism, I chose it because it's a very prominent issue that hasn't faded. It's important to me because the people who are meant to protect us aren't doing so, and are abusing their power to hurt us. I think people should know that not all police are bad, there are bad apples, but not every single one of them is evil or trying to hurt you. My thought process for picking the images i picked were because they all had powerful signs with a strong message. All the signs mean something important and add to the overall message, i made the most important ones pop out the most so they’d be drawn to it immediately.]</td>
   		<td>[Piece 2: I cropped the background and colored it to green, then applied a filter which used the green from the background. I messed around until I found one that really popped out to me. The first tool I used was the crop tool to crop the background. The second tool was the paint bucket to color the background. And finally I used the filters to change the picture. I used a character from the game god of war, I picked him because I thought he was cool, and he was the first to pop into my mind when i needed to pick something to add to.]</td>
   		<td>[Piece 3: To come up with this animal I was thinking about lethal animals I really liked, along with animals I thought were cute. The axolotl looks cute and friendly, the mantis shrimp is very lethal, able to punch fast enough it makes a bubble of air hotter than the surface of the sun, and the killer whale is a bully of the sea. My animal has the ability to punch so fast it creates an air bubble hotter than the sun, it can exhale hot air that'll cook anything in front of it. I turned my animal into a hybrid by getting the axolotl’s face, using it as on the orca body, which was my base, the mantis shrimp was added so it could defend itself using the clubs it was given.]</td>
